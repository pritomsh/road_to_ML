# Machine Learning
- Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific task by learning from data, without being explicitly programmed.


## Types of Machine Learning algorithms
 - [Supervised learning](#supervisedlearning)
 - [Unsupervised learning](#unsupervisedlearning)
 - [Semi-supervised learning](#semi-supervisedlearning)
 - [Reinforcement learning](#reinforcementlearning)
